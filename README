BUILD
=====
just run:

make

an executable of the name "OpenBOR" will be created.

possible flags to make:

NO_GL=1 BUILD_DEBUG=1 make #will build without opengl but with debugging support

OpenBOR directory layout:
      -> OpenBOR       (executable)
      -> Paks/         (put paks or directories with extracted paks)

ABOUT
=====

OpenBOR is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine, which was originally
created by http://www.senileteam.com.

this is a fork of "official OpenBOR" (i.e. from lavalit forums) 
by rofl0r aka anallyst, former "OpenBOR team" member.

his work on OpenBOR started back with (~ SVN rev 2900+).
he left the lavalit team due to internal differences at around SVN rev 3316 and 
started his own fork.

instead of adding features over features, it is the intent to strip off unnecesary
stuff and simplify things, while staying compatible to the existing mods and POSIX.

this is a huge task, since OpenBOR source is really badly designed 
(as can be expected of any good C source taken by gamers and scriptkiddies and 
collectively extended with half-baked features).

a plan is to add lua scripting support at some point in the future, and the
ugly and slow "C script" interpreter code can be removed and the good mods be
converted to lua.

Current Situation/Comparison with "official" OpenBOR
====================================================
PAKS:
  since commit a10ae8340ac9187d2590fa0ce8a3390122b570e1 the internal layout of
  .pak files has changed to simplify things.
  filenames are stored in unix fashion (/) and lowercase only.
  to make old pak files compatible, they have to be "converted":

  extract them using the borpak tool in tools/borpak,
  then repack them using the same tool.
  this results in a fresh pak in the required format.

  this change made it possible to use extracted paks in a directory.
  you can simply create a directory in the Paks dir for each game
  (i.e. Paks/MyGame/data/)

BLOAT:
  OpenBOR (anallyst edition) x64 binary           :  750 KB
  OpenBOR (lavalit edition, rev 3320)  x64 binary : 1250 KB
  OpenBOR (lavalit edition, rev 3600+) x64 binary : probably 1.5 MB+

SPEED:
  anallysts work on OpenBOR made for huge speed improvements in loading times.
  most mods now load in an instant and took several seconds (up to minutes (!))
  formerly.
  this improvements have gone into the lavalit version as well, but some team
  members there prefer seeing a moving loading bar between levels over instant
  loading, so some of the optimisations has been removed by them.
  it's likely that the lavalit version will get slower and slower over time.
  
  this fork is currently the fastest openbor version available.
  
MOD COMPATIBILITY:
  some upstream features have been ported so mods relying on OpenBOR 36xx features
  should work exactly as intended.

  compatibilty to older mods should be even better as the lavalit version
  as some bugs have been fixed that prevented some mods to work with anything
  newer than rev 28xx.

PLATFORMS:
  support for any non-posix compatible game console has been removed.
  this fork builds well on any posix compatible platform that has ports
  of libogg/vorbis and SDL.
  this means it should build on any linux based device, *BSD, etc.
  possibly even mingw.
  we're taking the stance than rather to buy a commercial game console and
  crack it for homebrew usage, you should rather buy products that are intended
  for homebrewers and thus support the companies producing them.
